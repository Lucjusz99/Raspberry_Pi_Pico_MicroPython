All the files in this folder should be saved on your Pico. Use the scan.py program to get your LCD displays adress.
Next convert it from decima to hexadecimal value and add it in the main.py file as "I2C_ADDR".
In my case the decimal value was 39 wich converts into 27 hexadecilam so I write 0x27 in my main.py file
